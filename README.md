# PassStatMKR
Modified software to run the PassStat potentiostat using an Arduino MKR Zero. Initial code provided by Raymond Campagnolo.

The PassStat (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ohx.2022.e00290) is a low-cost potentiostat based around the Teensy 3.6. However, the Teensy 3 series is now deprecated, and the Teensy 4 series lacks the DAC pin needed for this application. The code and notes in this repository provide updates so that the PassStat board may be used with the Arduino MKR Zero instead of a Teensy.
